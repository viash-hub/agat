name: agat_sp_statistics
description: |-
  The script provides exhaustive statistics of a gft/gff file.
  /!\ If you have isoforms in your file, even if correct, some values calculated
  might sounds incoherent: e.g. total length mRNA can be superior than the genome size.
  Because all isoforms length is added... It is why by default
  we always compute the statistics twice when there are isoforms, once with the
  isoforms, once without (In that case we keep the longest isoform per locus).

  description: Bolean - When this option is used, an histogram of distribution of
    the features will be printed in pdf files in a folder with distribution_plots
    suffix. (d means distribution, p means plot).
  required: no
  alternatives: -p
- name: --verbose
  type: boolean_true
  description: Verbose option. To modify verbosity. Default is 1. 0 is quiet, 2 and
    3 are increasing verbosity.

  description: Bolean - When this option is used, the raw data (same as used to create
    histogram of distribution of the features) are printed in a dedicated folder with
    raw_data suffix.
  alternatives: -r
- name: --yaml
  type: boolean_true
  description: Bolean - When this option is activated, a second output will be printed
    either in STDOUT if no output provided or in <output.yaml> (a .yaml suffix is
    added to the --output value provided).
  direction: output

  type: file
  description: 'String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml
    file from the working directory if any,  otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml
    shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose".
    The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file
    (located elsewhere or named differently).'
