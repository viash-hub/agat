description: |-
  The script looks for other ORF in UTRs (UTR3 and UTR5) of each gene model described in the gff file.
  Several ouput files will be written if you specify an output.
  One will contain the gene not modified (intact), one the gene models fixed.
usage: |-

  type: boolean_true
  description: By default we predict protein in UTR3 and UTR5 and in both direction.
    The fusion assumed can be between gene in same direction and in opposite direction.
    If RNAseq data used during the annotation was stranded, only fusion of close genes
    oriented in same direction are expected. In that case this option should be activated.
    When activated, we will try to predict protein in UTR3 and UTR5 only in the same
    orientation than the gene investigated.

    The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file
    (located elsewhere or named differently).'
