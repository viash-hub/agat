description: |-
  The script aims to remove from a gff file all the sequence that have a similarity
  over THRESHOLD with another sequence (will keep only one).
  This is typically useful when creating a list of mRNA to use to train abinitio gene finder.
  A reciprocal blast of the sequences need to have been performed prior
  to the use of this script in order to get the blastp input file.
