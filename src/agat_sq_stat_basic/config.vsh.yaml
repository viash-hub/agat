arguments:
- name: --input
  type: file
  description: 'STRING: Input GTF/GFF file. Several files can be processed at once:
    -i file1 -i file2'
  required: true
  alternatives:
  - -i
  - --gff
  - --file
- name: --genome
  type: string
  description: That input is design to know the genome size in order to calculate
    the percentage of the genome represented by each kind of feature type. You can
    provide an INTEGER or the genome in fasta format. If you provide the fasta, the
    genome size will be calculated on the fly.
  required: true
  alternatives: -g
- name: --inflate
  type: boolean_true
  description: 'Inflate the statistics taking into account feature with multi-parents.
    Indeed to avoid redundant information, some gff factorize identical features.
    e.g: one exon used in two different isoform will be defined only once, and will
    have multiple parent. By default the script count such feature only once. Using
    the inflate option allows to count the feature and its size as many time there
    are parents.'
- name: --output
  type: file
  description: 'STRING: Output file. If no output file is specified, the output will
    be written to STDOUT. The result is in tabulate format.'

- name: --config
  type: file
  description: 'String - Input agat config file. By default AGAT takes as input agat_config.yaml
    file from the working directory if any,  otherwise it takes the orignal agat_config.yaml
    shipped with AGAT. To get the agat_config.yaml locally type: "agat config --expose".
    The --config option gives you the possibility to use your own AGAT config file
    (located elsewhere or named differently).'
